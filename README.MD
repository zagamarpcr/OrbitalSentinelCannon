Hello, I am Comet. I am a web designer and coder not by study, but by hobby. This is 1 of my projects to see how far we can push the boundries of web development. Introducing, The Orbital Sentinel Cannon. Also called OSC.

# what it does

The OSC is a test DDoS tool that originates from my idea of the ping of death.

## What is DDoS

DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service, and DoS stands for Denial of Service. It's a type of cyber attack where an attacker attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This traffic can come from a network of infected computers, known as a botnet, or from a large number of compromised devices.

Example:
Imagine a physical store with a limited number of entrances. A DDoS attack is like having a large crowd of people trying to enter the store at the same time, making it impossible for legitimate customers to enter. The store's resources are overwhelmed, and it becomes unavailable to those who need it.

## Types of DoS attacks

### Volume-Based Attacks: These attacks focus on overwhelming the network with a large amount of traffic, making it difficult for legitimate traffic to get through.
UDP floods: sending a large number of UDP packets to a network
ICMP floods: sending a large number of ICMP packets to a network
### Protocol Attacks: These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, such as TCP/IP.
SYN floods: sending a large number of TCP SYN packets to a network
Ping of Death: sending oversized ICMP packets to a network
### Application-Based Attacks: These attacks target specific applications or services, attempting to exhaust their resources. 
HTTP floods: sending a large number of HTTP requests to a web server
Slowloris: sending partial HTTP requests to a web server, keeping connections open
Teardrop Attack: This attack involves sending fragmented IP packets to a network, which can cause the network to become overwhelmed and crash.
IP Fragmentation Attack: This attack involves sending IP packets that are too large for the network to handle, causing the network to become overwhelmed and crash.
Resource Exhaustion: This attack involves repeatedly requesting access to a resource, eventually overwhelming the web application and causing it to crash.

## Types of DDoS Attacks:

### Amplification Attacks: These attacks use a third-party service to amplify traffic, making it difficult to block the attack.
DNS amplification attacks: exploiting DNS servers to amplify traffic
NTP amplification attacks: exploiting NTP servers to amplify traffic
